# Pre-work - *Memory Game*

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Nihal Ernest**

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [x] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [x] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
N/A

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
The main challenge I encountered was coding the game logic. Due to it being my first coding experience in JavaScript, I was not familiar with it's syntax. However, with trial and error, I soon realized that it was very similar to that of Java and C++, in which I have programming experience.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I am interesting in learning more about how websites with complex interactions are made. For example, a game like krunker.io uses 3D graphics and takes mouse and keyboard input. I am interested in learning how a framework can be built around an application such as that. I am also interested in learning how to link pre-existing applications, programmed in other languages, to websites.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
With more time, I would focus on expanding the number of buttons, the look of the buttons, and the range and compelxity of the audio. Adding patterns or images to the button's looks can make the game more puzzle-like. Additionally, complex audio can be used to form more rythmic patterns. Finally, I would try and implement randomized patterns, a timer, and some sort of scoring system. The ability to save scores could also lead to making a leaderboard, which would be useful for multiplayer purposes.
